# DistributedComputation

* Developed interprocess library
  interaction through messaging, which will be used in the future to study the basic properties of distributed computing systems.
  
* Developed a simple banking system that uses physical time to calculate the total amount of money in accounts in different branches of the bank.

* Modified the banking system to use logical clocks ( replace physical time with Lamport scalar time ).
